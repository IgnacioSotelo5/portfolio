## Formal education

### Full-Stack Web Development  
**Tandil Technological Cluster | 2023–2024**  
- **Associate Degree (2 years)**  
- I learned the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how to build full-stack applications using React and TypeScript on the frontend, leveraging Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI development.  
  On the backend, I worked with Node.js through modern frameworks like NestJS, focusing on scalability and clean architecture.  
  I also learned how to deploy applications using platforms like Vercel and Railway, and how to document my code thoroughly.  
  Additionally, I gained experience with relational databases — primarily MySQL — and used TypeORM for database management.  
  As a final project, I built a full-stack link shortener application, which I’m proud of because it allowed me to apply everything I learned in a real-world scenario.
