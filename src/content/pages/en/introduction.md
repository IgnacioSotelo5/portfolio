# Introduction

Welcome to my portfolio, disguised as technical documentation because developers trust docs more than flashy landing pages.

Here you'll find:
- **Projects**: Real applications I've built (with actual code)
- **Tech Stack**: Tools I use (and some I'm still learning)
- **Journey**: How I got here and where I'm going

Think of this as a README for my career. Let's get started!

## About me

I'm a 24-year-old fullstack developer from Mar del Plata, Argentina.  
My path into tech started in an unexpected place: my family’s bakery, where one day I thought, “there has to be a better way to do this.”  
That small thought sparked what became a full career shift into web development.

I hold an Associate’s degree in Full-Stack Web Development from Cluster Tecnológico Tandil, where I spent two years building everything from databases to deployments.  
Now I’m focused on integrating AI into practical applications and looking for my first professional role where I can contribute, learn, and grow.

## My journey

This journey started in 2022 when I was 21 years old. I was working as a baker and looking for a way to make my work more interesting.  
I discovered web development and began learning as a self-taught developer — watching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials and building small projects.

Then I discovered React through Midudev’s tutorials — a total game changer that showed me what modern web development could be.  
Later in 2023, a new Full-Stack Web Development program was announced in my town through Cluster Tecnológico Tandil, and I immediately enrolled.

It was a challenging two-year journey, but I learned a lot and I’m proud of what I accomplished, graduating in December 2024.  
Now, I’m looking for my first professional opportunity as a fullstack developer — a place where I can contribute, learn, and keep growing.

## What I'm working on

I'm currently working on several projects:

- **Bakery Management System** — A React Native app for my family business that handles inventory, recipe costing, and order management. Currently about 40% complete, with real-world testing planned soon.

- **AI Fundamentals Program** — Four-month course with Guayerd and IBM covering Python, machine learning, and modern AI tooling. It’s helping me bridge the gap between web development and AI — a direction I’m really excited about.

- **This Portfolio** — Learning by building. This documentation-style site is itself a project in modern web development with Astro and Tailwind, exploring collections, content layer, ClientRouter transitions, and more.

## What drives me

Building software that actually solves problems — not just looks good in a portfolio.  
Whether it’s web, mobile, or somewhere in between, I focus on creating applications that are scalable, maintainable, and enjoyable to use.

I’m constantly learning: currently diving deep into AI/ML and exploring how to apply these tools to real-world challenges.  
Lately, I’ve also become curious about biomedical engineering — the idea of combining code with healthcare feels like where technology can make its biggest impact.  
While I can’t study it formally yet, I’m diving into every resource I can find to understand how code can transform healthcare.

What excites me most? Finding intersections between different fields.  
My bakery app is proof that good problems to solve are everywhere — you just need to look.  
To me, the best ideas often live at the intersection of disciplines — and that’s exactly where I want to build.

## What's next

I'm currently open to opportunities as a **Full-Stack**, **Frontend**, or **Mobile Developer** — especially roles that combine real-world problem solving with creativity and impact.

If you’d like to collaborate or think I could be a good fit for your team, feel free to reach out or explore my projects section.  
Let’s build something meaningful.
