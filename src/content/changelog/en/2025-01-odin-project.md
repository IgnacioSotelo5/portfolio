I joined The Odin Project and started participating more actively in developer communities.

It's not just about learning alone. It's about surrounding yourself with people who share your goals, face your same challenges, and from whom you can constantly learn.

I also joined SysArmy, FrontendCafé, and I'm still in the Midudev community.

Development isn't just code. It's also community.
