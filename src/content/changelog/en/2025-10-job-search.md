After months of preparation, I made the decision to focus 100% on landing my first position as a developer.

It's not easy. The market is tough, there are fewer junior openings than a couple of years ago, and the competition is fierce. But every application, every "no," every silence, is part of the process.

I'm applying to every opportunity where my profile fits. Giving up is not an option.
