I sold my motorcycle.

It wasn't easy. It was something I wanted, something I earned with effort. But I needed a computer to seriously study programming.

I posted the ad on May 12. Days later, I had the money to buy my PC.

That decision was a turning point. I didn't just buy a computer—I made a commitment to myself. I sacrificed something I wanted for something I needed for my future.

I don't regret it.
