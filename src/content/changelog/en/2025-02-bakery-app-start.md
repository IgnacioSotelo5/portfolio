I started developing a mobile app to digitize my family's bakery operations.

What began as a project to learn React Native became something bigger: a real tool solving real problems.

**What I'm learning:**
- Mobile development with React Native and Expo
- Mobile routing is completely different from web (stacks, screens, tabs)
- Efficient backend communication in mobile contexts
- List optimization and performance on devices
- MongoDB with Prisma ORM
- Secure authentication with tokens stored in `expo-secure-store`

The architecture is designed for future scalability to web. Modular, separated by concerns, ready to grow.

**Why it matters:**
This project forced me to think about UX for non-technical users (my family), optimize for unstable connections, and design for the real world, not just tutorials.

It's a work in progress, but every feature I implement teaches me something new.
