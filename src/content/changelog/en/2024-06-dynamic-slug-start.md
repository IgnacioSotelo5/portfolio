I started my final bootcamp project: a complete fullstack URL shortener.

**What I built:**
- URL shortening system with customizable links
- Automatic QR code generation
- Full authentication and authorization system
- Dashboard with detailed analytics: clicks, referrers, devices, browsers, OS
- Robust backend with NestJS and TypeScript
- Relational database with MySQL and TypeORM

**The technical challenge:**
I wanted to understand the complexity of building a tool like this from scratch. Not just making it "work"—I wanted to do it right.

The most interesting parts were:
- Creating a **custom decorator in NestJS** to handle redirections
- Implementing **interceptors** to capture and process requests
- Designing an **analytics system** that logs everything without impacting performance
- Middleware architecture for validations and security

This project taught me more than any tutorial. I faced real problems, made architectural decisions, and took it to production.

**Duration:** June - December 2024  
**Result:** A project I'm genuinely proud of.
