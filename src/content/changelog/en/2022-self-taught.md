I started my web development journey completely self-taught.

I began with the basics: **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Nothing fancy, just documentation, YouTube tutorials, and lots of practice.

After understanding the fundamentals, I jumped into **React**. Midudev, Gonzalo Pozzo (goncy), and other Spanish-speaking content creators were my teachers.

I had no formal structure. No "curriculum." Just:
- Insatiable curiosity
- Time (lots of time after work)
- The desire to understand how things work

**This was the moment I discovered that web development wasn't just a hobby—it was something I was truly passionate about.**

Every bug I fixed, every concept I understood, every project I finished (no matter how small), confirmed that this was the path I wanted to follow.

Without knowing it at the time, I was building the foundation for everything that would come next.
