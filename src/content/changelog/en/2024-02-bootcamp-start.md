I started the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at the Tandil Technology Cluster. I realized I wanted to achieve this goal when, on the day of the first class, I was rushing back from the Camino de los Arrayanes in Villa la Angostura to attend class at a gas station 🤣.

Online format. Almost 2 years long. While working at the bakery.

It's going to be tough, I know. But I'm committed.

I had already been studying on my own since 2022, watching creators like Midudev and Gonzalo Pozzo (goncy), building projects by myself. But I needed structure, a complete program, and a diploma to validate what I know.

This is the start of something big.
