I quit football. While this isn't tech-related, sharing it here is a bit of a relief.

I played at my club since I was 4 years old. It was something I deeply loved, and recently I was even getting paid for it—a good amount, too.

I quit thinking I would quickly find a job as a dev. But... it didn't happen that way.

I still regret it. But I also understand that sometimes hard decisions are part of the journey. Prioritizing my tech career meant sacrificing something I really cared about.

Maybe there will be a new opportunity to feel that sensation again.
