I graduated from the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at the Tandil Technology Cluster.

Almost 2 years of intense study while working at the bakery and playing at my club. It was tough, but I made it.

My final project was Dynamic Slug, a fullstack URL shortener that I built completely on my own, from start to finish. I'm proud of that.

My teachers highlighted that it was a complex project, with a lot of logic behind it, and well executed. That meant a lot to me.

Now comes the hardest part: landing my first job as a developer.
