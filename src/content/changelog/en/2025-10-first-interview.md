I had my first technical interview for a React Native Developer position.

It was an eye-opening experience—more than nerves or the outcome, I realized that all the effort (projects, learning, practice) was worth it. I was able to explain my technical decisions, discuss architecture, and defend my solutions with confidence.

This is just the beginning.
