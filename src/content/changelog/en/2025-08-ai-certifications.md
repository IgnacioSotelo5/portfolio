I completed two AI certifications:

- **IBM - Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence** (end of August)
- **Alura - AI Immersion with Gemini** (August 1-3)

AI is transforming software development, and I want to be at the forefront of that transformation.

I don't just want to use AI tools—I want to understand how they work and how to integrate them into real solutions.

This was a small step before starting the `Introduction to Artificial Intelligence` certification from Guayerd and IBM, a course that will allow me to understand the fundamentals of AI and how to apply them in my projects. It lasts 4 months and covers Python, ML, and related topics.
