I started working more steadily at the family bakery.

I finished high school in 2019, and the family's economic situation required me to help more actively in the business.

I don't hate this job; in fact, I respect and admire my father a lot for having worked at this all his life—it's what he got. I want to change my story, break the cycle, and create a different future for myself.

Every day at the bakery reminds me why I'm fighting to change my situation. It's not just about "getting a better job"—it's about creating the future I want to live.
