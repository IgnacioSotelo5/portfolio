I wanted to understand how to integrate AI into real-world projects, so I built Commit Genius.

It's a tool that analyzes code changes (`git diff`) and automatically generates commit messages following Conventional Commits.

**What I learned:**
- Integrating AI APIs (Groq)
- Crafting effective prompts
- Modern backend with ElysiaJS
- How AI can automate repetitive tasks

It was a short but intense project. It showed me that AI isn't magic—it's about understanding how to communicate with models and designing prompts that yield consistent results.
