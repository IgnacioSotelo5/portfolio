# My workflow

Here's how I approach building applications:

## How I build

I build full-stack applications using **React** and **TypeScript** on the frontend, leveraging **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive UI development. On the backend, I work with **Node.js** through frameworks like **Express** and **NestJS**, choosing the right tool based on project complexity.

For mobile development, I use **React Native** with **Expo**, allowing me to build cross-platform apps while maintaining code quality. My bakery management app taught me the importance of understanding native build processes and performance optimization.

## Working with data

I'm comfortable with both **SQL** (MySQL) and **NoSQL** (MongoDB) databases, selecting the appropriate one based on data structure needs. I use **TypeORM** for relational data and **Prisma** for document-based storage, always prioritizing data integrity and efficient queries.

## AI integration

Recently, I've focused on integrating AI into practical applications. My commit generator project introduced me to working with AI APIs like **Groq**, where I learned prompt engineering, response parsing, and handling the unpredictability of AI-generated content.

Currently expanding these skills through a 4-month AI Fundamentals program, learning **Python**, **Machine Learning** basics, and modern AI tooling.

## Development workflow

I use **Git** for version control with clear, meaningful commits, jumping between branches and keeping track of changes. I'm comfortable with **terminal/CLI** workflows, deploy applications on platforms like **Vercel** and **Railway**, and document my code thoroughly.

My approach emphasizes **TypeScript** for type safety, **component-based architecture** for maintainability, and **responsive design** principles for accessibility across devices.

## What I'm learning

Currently deepening my knowledge in:
- **Machine Learning** fundamentals and practical applications
- **Advanced TypeScript** patterns and best practices  
- **System design** for scalable applications
- **Docker** for consistent development environments
